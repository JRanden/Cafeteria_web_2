First u will be greeted by a home page where you can choose to see the menu or login as admin you can navigate back and forth from all sites using the navigation bar at the top of the screen. 

At the login page you will be promte with a username and password field. Write in the admin info provided above and you will have acsess to change the database. The intended function here is for the admin to change and find prices of products and the possibility to add and remove data. The database is structred with two collections one for Variable Products and one for Constant Products for easy classification and sorting.

The menu page displays all the data in the databse in two different tables one for each collection.

I ran into som problems with the css on the menu page with the padding and text wrapping not working as i have intended. My focus has been on the logical parts of the code so i will look more into that in the future
